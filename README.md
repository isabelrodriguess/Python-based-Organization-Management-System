This project is a simple staff management system designed to manage employee information within a company. The system provides the following functionalities:

Display all staff information: This feature shows a table with the names and departments of all staff members currently in the system.

Modify staff department: Users can update the department of an existing staff member, allowing for easy management of staff roles and responsibilities.

Search staff by name: This allows users to search for a staff member by name and view their details, including their department.

Add new staff: Users can add a new staff member to the system by inputting their name and department, expanding the company's staff list.

Delete staff: This function allows users to remove a staff member from the list, effectively deleting their information from the system.

The system operates through a simple text-based menu interface, where users can select options to interact with the staff data. The program uses Python and the tabulate library to present staff data in a clear, tabular format.

This project demonstrates key programming concepts such as functions, list and dictionary manipulation, and user input validation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of data entered into the system.
